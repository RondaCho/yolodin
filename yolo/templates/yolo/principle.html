                        <p>When you come up with a goal, it is crucial that it motivates you. This means making sure that they are important to you, and that there is value in achieving them.</p>
                        <p>Only when the goal is meaningful to you and the outcome matters, you can be motivated to move toward it.</p>
                        <p>So, set goals that relate to the high priorities in your life<span class="badge" style="background-color:lightgrey; margin-top:10px;"><a href="http://www.career-text.biz/values_assessment.htm">Go Find My Priority Values</a></span></p>
                        <p>Write down why it is valuable and important to you to motivate you in the process of achieving it.</p>

                        <p>Setting goals in writing is important. The physical act of writing down a goal(even it's on your computer) is real and tangible.</p>
                        <p>You have no excuse for forgetting about it.</p>
                        <p>When you write down a goal, don't forget to add 'why this is important and valuable to you'. Looking back to this can certainly help you boost your passion about that dream.</p>

                        <p>You may already know what SMART goals already. But do you always apply the rule? In order fot goals to be powerful, they should be designed to be SMART.</p>
                        <p>Goals should be:</p>
                        <li>Specific</li>
                        <p><small>Your goal must be clear and well defined. Vague or generalized goals are unhelpful because they don't guide you to a precise direction.</small></p>
                        <li>Measurable</li>
                        <p><small>Include precise amounts, dates, and so on in your goals so you can measure your degree of success. Without a way to measure your success you miss out on the celebration when you achieve something.</small></p>
                        <li>Attainable</li>
                        <p><small>Make sure that it's possible to achieve the goal you set. Otherwise, you will only demoralize yourself and erode your confidence. <strong>However</strong>, resist the urge to set goals that are too easy. By setting realistic yet challenging goals, you hit the balance you need. </small></p>
                        <li>Relevant</li>
                        <p><small>Goals should be relevant to the direction you want your life and career to take. By keeping goals aligned with this, you will develop the focus you need to get ahead and do what you want.</small></p>
                        <li>Time Bound</li>
                        <p><small>Your goal <strong>must</strong> have a deadline. Again, this means that you know when you celebrate success. When working on a deadline, your sense of urgency increases and achievemen will come that much quicker</small></p>

                        <p>By writing out the individual steps, and then crossing each one off as you complete it, you will realize that you are making progress towards your ultimate goal.</p>
                        <p>This is especially important if your goal is big and demanding, or long-term</p>

                        <p>A goal that you can actually see is massively more powerful than a goal you write down on a checklist. This works well if you are a VISUAL learner</p>
                        <p>When adding a new YOLO list, make sure that you add a powerful, motivational image related to that listing.</p>

                        <p>Announcing your goals and visions can help you get closer to your goal.</p>
                        <p style="font-size:0.9rem;">Making yourself accountable to your friends and family is one of the best ways to reach your goals.</p>
                        <p style="font-size:0.9rem;">Sure, it's uncomfortable to share your setbacks. But when you do, you're going to get emails from friends who have experienced the same and they'll get your mind back on track.</p>
                        <p style="font-size:0.9rem;">And when you share with them them milestones you reach, you're going to get applause from people wishing hey were you and reaching those same goals too.</p>
                        <p style="font-size:0.9rem;">If you are the masochistic, egotistical type, this tactic works wonders. Just think, you've told everyone you know that you're heading out to accomplish this goal. If you don't do it, there will be some embarrassment in it for you.</p>

                        <p>Many people abandon goals because they're just too dang big. If you've done this to yourself, stop now. Change the game plan</p>
                        <p>Select milestones to get there and make each of those a tiny goal.</p>
                        <p>Breaking your bg goal into small ones will make jumping off the cliff of achieving your goal a much more feasible option for you.</p>

                        <p>One of the best ways to knock out a goal is to put it on your calendar. If you put a stake in the ground and impose a date on yourself, you're much more likely to reach it. </p>
                        <p>Utilize Yolodin's objective date setting!</p>
